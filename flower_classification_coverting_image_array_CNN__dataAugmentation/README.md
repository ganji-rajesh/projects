# Object:
Classify Flower images using Computer vison.
## Data source: google

# Learings/Outcomes:
* 1) Classifying flower images using Convolutional Neural Networks
* 2) Handling underfitting problem using Dropout approach
* 3) Increasing accuracy of Neural Network futher using Transfer Learning (Pre trained model)

# Conclusin:
After implementing Transfer Learning, accuracy while training increased to 88% and on validation increased to 86% <br> Hence, we can conclude that Transfer learning saves computational resources and time
